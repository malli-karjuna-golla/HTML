---------------- CSS Syntax and Selectors ----------- 

CSS Selectors
->THey are used to selecting HTML elements based on their element name,id,attributes,etc.
->It can select one or more elements simultaneously.
->CSS elements can be divided into five categories:

*simple selector:- 
 It is used to select the HTML elements based on their element name,id,attributes,etc.

*Combinators selectors:- 
 It is used for explaining the relationship between two selectors.

*pseudo-classes selector:- 
 It is used to define the special state of an element.

*pseudo Elements selector:- 
 It is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected elements.

*Attribute selector selector:- 
 It is used to select an element with some specific attribute or attribute value.

The simple selector can be categorized in 3 ways:

 * CSS element selector:
 ->The element selector in css is used to select HTML elements that are required to be styled.
 ->In a selector declaration,there is the name of the HTML element and the CSS properties which are to be applied to that element are written inside the brackets.
 syntax:
   element_name {
      // CSS Property
   }

*  CSS id selector:
->The #id selector is used to set the style of the given id.
->The id attribute is the unique identifier in an HTML document.
->The id selector is used with a # character.
syntax:
    #id_name {
        // css Property
    } 
    
* CSS class selector:
->The class selector is used to select all elements which belong to a particular class attribute.
->To select the elements with a particular class,use (.) character with specifying the class name.
->The class name is mostly used to set the CSS property to the given class.
syntax:
    class_name {
        // css property
    } 
    
 Notes:
  /* write CSS here */
  h1,h2,h3,div{
    color:red;/// h1,h2,h3 and div will be of red
  } 
  
----------- CSS Specificity -------- 
->CSS style applied by referencing external stylesheet has lowest precedence and is overridden by internal and inline CSS.
->Internal CSS is overridden by inline CSS.
->Inline CSS has highest priority and overriddens all other selectors.

## Specificity hierarchy:
  Every element selector has a position in the hierarchy

  1.Inline style:Inline style has highest priority.

  2.Identifier(ID):ID have the second highest priority.

  3.Classes,pseudo-classes and attributes:Classes,pseudo-classes and attributes are come next.

  4.Elements and pseudo-classes:Elements and pseudo-classes have lowest priority.

Note:
 * When two or more selectors have equal specificity,the last(latest) one counts.
 * Universal selectors like body and inherited selectors have least specificity.

 --------- Comments in CSS ------- 

 ->comments in CSS is text which is not parase and is thus ignored.
 ->They make the program more readable and understandable and increases the quality of code.
 syntax:
   /*content*/
Note:
 * We can add comments at any place of code even in the middle
 * You can use /* */ to create multiline comments also.
