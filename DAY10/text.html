---------- CSS Units -------

* %:- The % unit is used to set the font-size relative the current font-size. 

* em:- It is used to set the relative size,and it is relative to the font-size of the element.
   Note:Here 2em meaning 2 times the size of current font. 

* rem:- Relative to the browser base font-size. 

* Px:- It defines the font-size in terms of fixels. (96px=1in)

* vh:- Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.

* vw:- Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport.


-------Diiference b/w em and rem Units--------
There are two types of CSS units.They are :
      1.Absolute units:- 
                     ->Thse are fixed and not relative to anything else.
                     ->They are always identical and involves cm,mm,px,etc.
      2.Relative Units:-
                     ->It may be the size of the parent element or the size of main HTML.
                     ->It involves em,rem,vw,vh,etc and those are also scalable units.
                     

--------- Box Model -------- 

->The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including border,margin,padding, and the content itself.
->It is used to create the design and layout of web pages.
->It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements
->The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.

## properties ##

*content:This property is used to displays the text,images,etc,that can be sized using the width & height property.

*padding:This property is used to create space around the element,inside any defined border.

*border:This property is used to cover the content & any padding,& also allows to set the style,color, and width of the border.

*margin:This property is used to create space around the element ie,around the border area.

->While setting the width and height properties of an element with css,we have only set the width and height of the content area. 
->We need to add padding,borders,and margins in order to calculate the full size of an element.
consider an below example 

p {
   width:80px;
   height:70px;
   margin:0;
   border:2px solid black;
   padding:5px;
}

The total width for the element can be calculated as :
  Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

Margin Collapse:
 When two margins from different elements overlap the equivalent margin is the greater of two margin,This is called margin collaopse.
 
 --------- Display property -------

 ->The display property in CSS defines how the components(div,hyperlink,heading,etc)are going to be placed on the webpage.
 ->As the name suggests,this property is used to define the display different parts of a web page.
 syntax:
 display:value;
     ## Property values ##
*inline:It is used to displays an element as an inline element.

*block:It is used to displays an element as a block element.
       This property is used as the default property of div.
       This property places the div one after the another vertically.
       the height and width of the div can be changed using the block property.

*contents:It is used to disappear the container.

*flex:It is used to display an element as a block-level flex container.

*grid:It is used to display an element as a block-level grid container.

*inline-block:It is used to display an element as an inline-level block container.
              This features uses the both properties(block and inline).
              So,this property aligns the div inline but the difference is it can edit the height and width of block.
              Basically,it will align the div both in block and inline fashion.  

*inline-grid:It is used to display an element as an  grid-level block container.

*inline-table:It is used to diaplay an inline-level table.
              This property is the default property of anchor tags.
              This is used to place the div inline i.e in a horizontal manner.
              The inline display property ignores the  height and the width set by the user. 

*list-item:It is used to display all the  elements in <li> element.

*run-in:It is used to display an element inline or block level,depending on the context.

*Table:It is used to set the behaviour as <table> for all elements.

*table-caption:It is used to set the behaviour as <caption> for all elements.
   
*table-column-group:It is used to set the behaviour as <column> for all elements.
   
*table-header-group:It is used to set the behaviour as <header> for all elements.
   
*table-footer-group:It is used to set the behaviour as <footer> for all elements.
   
*table-row-group:It is used to set the behaviour as <row> for all elements.
   
*table-cell:It is used to set the behaviour as <td> for all elements.
   
*table-column:It is used to set the behaviour as <col> for all elements.

*table-row:It is used to set the behaviour as <tr> for all elements.

*none:It is used to remove the element.
      This property hides the div or the container which uses this property.
      Using it on one of the div it will make working clear.

*initial:It is used to set the default value.

*inherit:It is used to inherit the property from it's parents elements.

-------- Position Property -------
->The position property in CSS tells about the method of positioning for an element or an HTML entity.
->There are five different types of position property available in CSS:
     1.fixed
     2.static
     3.Relative
     4.Absolute
     5.Sticky
->The positioning of an element can be done using the top,right,bottom,and down
->These specify the distance of an HTML element from the edge of the viewport.
->To set the position by the four properties,we have to declare the positioning method

*Fixed:
->Any HTML element with position:fixed property will be positioned relative to the viewport.
->An element with fixed positioning allows it to retain at the same position even we scroll the page.
->we can set the position of the element using the top.right,bottom,left.

*Static:
->This method of positioning is set by default.
->if we don't mention the method of positioning for any element,the element has the position:static method by default.
->By defining static,the top,right,bottom and left will not have any control over the element.
->The element will be positioned with the normal flow of the page.

*Relative:
->an element with position:relative is positioned relatively with the other elements which are sitting at top of it.
->If we set it's top,right,bottom,or,left,other elements will not fill up the gap left by the element.
->An element with it's position set to relative and when is adjusted using top,left,right will be positioned relative to it's original position.

*Absolute:
->an element with position:absolute will be positioned with respect to it's nearest Non-static ancestor.
->The positioning of this element does not depend upon its siblings or the elements which are at the same level.

*Stiky:
->Element with position:sticky and top:0 played a role between fixed & relative based on the position whwre it is placed.
->if the element is placed at the middle of the document then when the user scrolls the document.
->The sticky element starts scrolling until it touches the top.
->whwn it touches the top,it will be fixed at that place in spite of further scrolling we can stick the element at the bottom,with the bottom properly.
