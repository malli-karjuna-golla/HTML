--------------------- Logical Operators Part 1 -------------- 

->Logical operators in JavaScript are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value based on the evaluation of those conditions.
->They are four main Logical operators:
  1.AND (&&) 
  2.OR  (//)
  3.NOT (!)
  4.Nullish Coalescing (??)

1.AND (&&) Operator:- 
 The AND operator returns true if all the conditions are true; otherwise it returns false. 
 
 Example:

 JavaScript 

 const physics = 90;
 const maths   = 95;
 const chemistry = 88;
 const biology = 96;

 if physics > 85 && maths > 85 && chemistry > 85 {
    console.log("You are eligible for engineering.");
 } else {
    console.log("Ypu are not eligible for engineering.");
 }

 output:
 You are eligible for engineering.

2.OR (//) Operator:- 
 The OR operator returns true if atleast one of the condition is true; otherwise, it returns false.
 
Example:

JavaScript 

const physics = 90;
const maths = 95;
const chemistry = 88;
const biology = 96;
if (physics > 90 // maths > 85 // chemistry > 89) {
    console.log("You are eligible for engineering");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible for engineering"); 
}

output:
You are eligible for engineering.

3.Not (!) Operator:- 
 ->The NOT operator reverses the Boolean value of the operand.
 ->If the operand ie true, it returns false, and if the operand is false, it returns true.

 Example 

 JavaScript 

  const isStudentEligible = false;
 if (!isStudentEligible) {
    console.log("You are not eligible.");
 } else {
    console.log("You are eligible.");
 }

 output:
 You are not eligible.
4.Nullish Coalescing:
 ->In JavaScript, nullish coalescing is a new type of logical operator that was introduced to help simplify handling undefined and null values.
 ->This operator can help prevent pitfalls that might occur when working with values like undefined, null, 0, or an empty string.

 * What is Nullish Coalescing (??)?
  ->The nullish coalescing operator (??) is used to assign a default value to a variable when the value is either null or undefined.
  ->This is particularly useful when you want to provide a fullback value only for null or undefined.
  ->But you want to keep values like 0 or an empty string ("") intact.
   Syntax:
   Let result = value ?? defaultvalue:

Example:

JavaScript

 const firstName = "Prakash";
 console.log(firstName ?? "Hidden Geek");

 output:
 "Prakash"

 JavaScript 

 Let firstName: // 'firstName' is undefined 
 console.log(firstname ?? "Hidden Geek") 

 output:
 "Hidden Geek"

 * Case of Empty String:

 ->Nullish coalescing does not treat an empty string ("") as a falsy value.
 ->This is different from OR (//) operator which would consider an empty String as falsy.

 JavaScript 

 Let firstName = "";
 console.log(firstName ?? "Hidden Geek");

 output:""

 * Difference Between ?? and //

 OR Operator:
 ->The OR operator returns the first truthy value in an expression.
 ->It will treat values like 0, ""(empty string), null, and undefined as falsy values.

 JavaScript 

 Let firstName = "";
 console.log(firstName // "Hidden Geek");

 output:
 "Hidden Geek"

 Nullish Coalescing (??) Operator:

 ->The nullish coalescing operator will only return the fallback value if the variable is null or undefined.
 ->It will not return the fallback value for falsy values like 0 or "". 
 
 JavaScript 

 Let firstName ="";
 console.log("FirtName ?? "Hidden Geek");

 output:""

 ---------------------- JavaScript Loops --------------- 

 ->Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly.
 ->JavaScript provides several types of loops, each with its unique use cases use cases and syntax.
 ->In this article, you will have a solid understanding of how to use these loops effectively in your Javascript code. 

 1.For Loop :-
  ->The for loop is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript.
  ->It provides a concise way to iterate over a range of values and is often preferred over the while loop due to it's compact syntax.
  
  syntax:
     
    For (initialization; condition;increment) {
        // code to be executed to each iteration
    }

 * Intialization: This statement is executed once before the loop starts.
   It typically initializes a counter variable.
   
 * Condition: This expression is evaluated before each iteration. 
  If the condition is true, the loop continues; if false, the loop stops.
  
 * Increment: This statement is executed after each iteration. It usually increments the counter variable

 Example: Printing "Hello" 10 times

 JavaScript 

 var i;
 for (i=0; i<10;i++)
{
    console.log("Hello World!");
}

output:
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!

2.While Loop :-

 ->A While loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
 ->The While loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

 syntax:

  while (boolean condition)
  {
    Loop statements...
  }

  Example 

  JavaScript 
  
   var i=1;
   while(i <=10)
   {
    console.log("Hello world!");
    i++;
   }

Output:
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!

3.D0-While Loop

->Do-while loop is similar to to the while loop, but it gurantees that the code inside the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

syntax:

 do 
 {
    statements.. 
 }
    while (condition);

 Example:

 Javascript 

 Let i=0;

 do {
    console.log(i);
     i++;
    } while (i<10);

output:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

Note:The Key difference between the while loop and the do-while loop is that the do while loop will execute the code inside the loop at least once, even if the condition is  intially false.

-------------- Functions In JavaScript ------------ 

->A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produces output.
->Basically, a function is a set of statements that perform some tasks or computations and returns the results to the user.
->The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the finction itself.
->Like, other programming languages, JavaScript also supports the use of functions.
->alert(), this is a built-in function in JavaScript.
->We can create functions in JavaScript using the keyword function.
 syntax:- 
   function functionName(Parameter1,Parameter2,..)
    {
      // Function body
    }

->To create a function in JavaScript, we have to first use the keyword function,separated by name of function and Parameters within parenthesis.
->The part of function inside curly braces{} is the body of function.

Rules for creating a function:
  *Every function should begin with the keyword function followed by.
  *A user defined function name which should be unique.
  *A list of parameters enclosed within parenthesis and separated by commas.
  *A list of statement composing the body of the function enclosed within curly braces {}. 

Example:

JavaScript

 function calcAddition(number1,number2)
 {
   return munber1 + number2;
 }

Function parameters:
  ->Parameters are additional infomation passed to a function.
  ->The parameters are passed to the function within parenthesis after the function name and separated by commas.
  ->A function in JavaScript can have any number of parameters and also at the same time a function in JavaScript can not have a single parameter.
Calling Functions:
  ->After defining a function, the next step is to call them to make use of the function.
  ->We can call a function by using the function name separated by the value of parameters enclosed between parenthesis and a semicolon at the end.
 syntax:
  functionName( Value1, Value2,..);

 JavaScript 
 
  function welcomeMsg(name) {
    console.log("Hello" + name +"welcome to GeeksforGeeks");
  }
   // creating a variable 
   var nameVal ="Admin";

   // calling the function
   welcomeMsg(nameVal);

 output:
 Hello Admin welcome to GeeksforGeeks
 
 Return Statement:
  ->There are some situations when we want to return some values from a function after performing some operations.
  ->In such cases, we can make use of the return statement in JavaScript.
  ->This is an optional statement and most of the times the last statement in a JavaScript function.
  ->The return statement begins with the keyword return separated by the value which we want to return from it.
  syntax:
   return value:

---------- Function declaration and types of functions in JS ----------------- 

->A function is basically a user-defined structure of code which we can use of any number of types by just calling it's entity.
->We can give any name to our defined functions and also pass any number of parameters to the function, even a non-parameterised function can also be valid.
 syntax:
   Function functionName() {
      //body
   }

->The parameters are values which is passed to the function which can be used to take values to the functions.
->The Arguments are the values which can be used to pass the values to function from the calling part of the function
 syntax:
   function FunctionName(Name) {

      // body
   } 
->This is the given function which would be used to take the parameters of the key name.

JavaScript 
  
function Print(nmae) {
   console.log(name);
}
Print("GeeksforGeeks");
Print("Anupam Gupta");

output:
GeeksforGeeks
Anupam Gupta

The function set of JS also contains a type of functions as:

Anonymous Functions:

->The anonymous functions are basically the functions which can be passed to a variable without having it's own identity.
->The AnonymousFunction is used to have the properties of the assigned function and it can also be called as the similar function like AnonumousFunction()
 syntax:
Let AnonymousFunction = Function{} {

   // body

}}






 }

 }


 }








}
