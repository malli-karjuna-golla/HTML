---------- Media Queries in CSS -----------

->Media queries in CSS is used to create a Responsive web page to make a user friendly website.
->It means that the view of web pages differ from system to system based on screen or media types.
->Media is allowing us to reshape and design the user view page of the website for specific devices like Tablets,Desktops,Moblie phones etc.
->Media queries cn be used to check many things like the following:
   1. Width and height of the device
   2. Orientation of the device
   3. Resolution of the device
   4. Aspect ratio of the device
   5. Color of the device
   6. Light level of the device
   
 ->A media query consist of a media type that can contain one or more expression which can be either true or false.
 ->The result of the query is true if the specified media matches the type of device where the document is displayed on.
 ->If the media query is true when the style is applied.
 ->In simple words,it uses the @media rule to add the block of CSS properties,based on certain conditions.
 syntax:
    @media not|only mediatype and (expressions)
     {
        CSS-Code;
    } 
-> we can add the breakpoint to see the screen width along with the width and height of the viewport for the different devices.
->A breakpoint is a point or key that determines when to change the layout by reshaping and adding the new rules inside the media queries.
->There are some common breakpoints,not a standard resolution,that can be used for the different widths & heights of devices.
 *For Moblie devices: 320px to 480px
 *For Tablets: 481px to 768px
 *For laptop or small-size screen:768px-1024px.
 *For Desktop or large-size screen:1024px-1200px.
 *For Extra large size device:1200px-more. 
->These breakpoints can help to build responsive designs(i.e mobile-first design) by specifying the different sets of values for width & height.
->We can also use the media queries for changing the layout of a webpage that will be depending on the orientation of the browser.
