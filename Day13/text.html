---------- Stacking Context ----------

->The stacking order describes the order in which elements are positioned by default.
->Html elements are positioned in the following order:
  *Root element (<html>)
  *Non-positioned elements (elements with position:static,which is the default positioning) in the order they are defined.
  *positioned elements (elements with position:relative,obsolute,fixed or sticky) in the order they are defined,appearing above non-positioned elements.

 Z-index:-
  ->In order to change the stacking order,we can use the Z-index. 
  ->Element with higher Z-index is placed on top of the element with lower Z-index. 
  ->In order to use the Z-index,elements should be positioned.
