---------------- JavaScript Comparision ------------ 

->In JavaScript, comparision operators are used to compare two values, returning a Boolean value (true or false).
->These operators are fundamental in conditional statements, loops, and logical expressions.
->Understanding how they work, including some of JavaScript's unique behaviour and quicks, can help you avoid common mistakes and unexpected results in your code.

1.Basic Comparision Operators:-
 ->Basic comparision operators compare two values and return a Boolean based on the condition being met.
 ->The following are the basic comparision operators in JavaScript:
      * Greater Than (>)
      * Lesser Than  (<)
      * Greater Than or Equal (>=)
      *Lesser Than or Equal (<=)
      
Example 

JavaScript 

console.log(50 > 30);
console.log(50 < 30); 
console.log(30>=30);
console.log(50<=40);
console.log(50==40);

output:-

true
False
true
false 
false 

2.Comparision of Strings:-
 ->In JavaScript strings are compared based on their ASCII (unicode) values.
 ->When comparing two strings, JavaScript checks thier characters from left to right, comparing the ASCII values of each character.

JavaScript 

console.log("apple" > "banana");
console.log("glowing" > "glow");

output:- 

false 
True

3.Type Coercian in Comparision:- 
 ->JavaScript performs type coercian in certain comparisions, meaning it automatically converts one data type to another.
 ->This can lead to unexpected results, especially when comparing Strings and numbers.

 JavaScript 

 console.log("2" > 1);
 console.log("01"==1);
 
 output:- 
 
 true 
 true 
 
 4.Strict Equality (===) vs.Loose Equality (==):- 
    *Loose Equality (==): converts the values before comparing them.
    *Strict Equality (===): Checks both the value and the type.
    
JavaScript 

console.log("01"===1);

output:- 

false 

Note:In general, It's advisable to use strict equality (===) to prevent unintentional type coercion that can lead to bugs.

5.Null and Undefined in Comparision:- 
 ->JavaScript has special rules when comparing null and undefined. While they are loosely equal (==), they are not strictly equal (===), they are not strictly equal.

 JavaScript

 console.log(null == undefined); 
 console.log(null === undefined);

 output:- 

 true 
 false 

 6.Null in Mathematical Comparisions:- 
  ->Null has unique behaviour when used in mathematical comparisions (such as <. >, <=, >=).
  ->In these comparisions, null is treated as 0.

  javaScript

  console.log(null > 0);
  console.log(null < 1);
  console.log(null >= 0);
  console.log(null == 0);
  
  output:- 
  
  false
  true
  true 
  false 
  
  Examples and Exercise:
  
  JavaScript

  console.log(3 <= 5);
  console.log("mango" > "banana");
  console.log("2" > "3");
  console.log(undefined == null);
  console.log(null === undefined);
  console.log(null < 1);

  output:- 

  true
  true
  false
  true
  false
  true

  Key Points:- 
   
  *Always use === instead of == to avold issues with type coercian.
  *String Comparisions are done based on AsCII (Unicode) values.
  *JavaScript automatically converts strings to numbers in numerical comparisions.
  *Null behaves differently in mathematical and equality comparisions.
  *undefined always results in false.

  -------------- JavaScript Conditional Statements ----------- 

->A conditional statement that allows the program to execute certain code based on a condition being true or false.
->conditional statements are a crucial part of any application, and in JavaScript , they are written using keywords like if, else. and else if.

1.If Statement:
  ->The If statement evaluates a condition, and if the condition is true, it executes the code inside the curly braces {}.
  ->If the condition is false, it does nothing unless paired with an else or else if statement.
  Syntax:
   if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true 
    }

Example:

JavaScript

 const isLoggedin = true:
 if (isLoggedin) {
    console.log(You are Logged in.");
 }

 output:
 You are loggedin 

 2.The else Statement:
   ->An else Statement is used to run a block of code when the condition in the if statement evalautes to false.
  Syntax:
   if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true 
   } else {
    // code to be executed if the condition is false
   }

Example:

JavaScript 

 const userage = 15;

 if (userAge > 16) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
 } else {
    console.log("You are not an adult.");
 }

 output:
  You are not an adult.

3.The else if Statement:
  ->In case you need to check multiple conditions, you can use the else if statement.
  ->This allows you to check additional conditions if the first if condition fails.
   Synatax:

  if (conditional) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true 
  } else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
  } else {
    // code to be executed if none of the above conditions are true 
  }

  Example:

  JavaScript
   
  const userAge =30;
  
  if (userAge < 18) {
    console.log("You are a minor.");
  } 
    else if (userAge >= 18 && userAge < 60)
  {
    console.log("You are an Adult.");
  } 
    else {
    console.log("You are a senior.");
  }  
  
  output:
  You are an adult.

  *Using Logical Operators
  ->JavaScript supports logical operators like AND (&&) and OR(//), and how to combine multiple conditions in JavaScript.
  ->We'll also dive into using the readline-sync module to handle user input for checking conditions dynamically.

   1.The AND Operator (&&):-
   
  ->The AND operator (&&) is used when you want to check if both conditons are true.
  ->If both conditions are true, the entire expression evaluates to true.

  Example:

  JavaScript 

  const readlinesync = require("readline-sync");
  const number = Number(readlinesync.question("Enter a number:"));
  const remainderAfterDivisionByThree = number % 3;
  const remainderAfterDivisionByFive  = number % 5;
  if (remainderAfterDivisionByThree === 0 && remainderAfterdivisionByFive === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else {
    console.log("The number is not divisible by both 3 and 5.");
  }

  output:
  Enter a number : 15
  Fizz

   2.The OR operator (//):
    
  ->The OR operator (//) is used when you want to check if either of the conditions is true.
  ->If atleast one condition is true, the expression evaluates to true.
  
  Example:

  JavaScript 

  const readlinesync = require("readline-sync");
  const number = Number(readlinesync.question("Enter a number:"));
  const remainderAfterDivisionByThree = number % 3;
  const remainderAfterDivisionByFive  = number % 5;
  if (remainderAfterDivisionByThree === 0 // remainderAfterdivisionByFive === 0) {
    console.log("buzz");
  } else {
    console.log("The number is not divisible by 3 or 5.");
  }

  output:
  Enter a number: 10
  buzz
  
    3.Combining Mutiple Conditions 

  ->You can combine multiple conditions using AND (&&) and OR (//) to create more complex decision-making scenarios.

  Example:

  JavaScript 

  const readlinesync = require("readline-sync");
  const number = Number(readlinesync.question("Enter a number:"));
  const remainderAfterDivisionByThree = number % 3;
  const remainderAfterDivisionByFive  = number % 5;
  const remainderAfterDivisionBySeven = number % 7;
  if (remainderAfterDivisionByThree === 0 && remainderAfterdivisionByFive === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else {
    console.log("Not divisible by both 3 and 5.");
  } 
  if (reaminderAfterDivisionByThree === 0 // remainderAfterDivisionByFive === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log("Not divisible by 3 or 5");
  }
  if (remainderAfterDivisionBySeven === 0) {
    console.log("BuzzBuzz");
  } else {
    console.log("Not divisible by 3, 5, and 7");
  } 
  
  output:
  Enter a number: 105
  Fizz
  buzz
  BuzzBuzz

  ------------------ JavaScript Ternary Operator ----------------

   ->Terinary operators offer a compact way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript.
   ->They can be used as a shorthand for if-else statements, making your code more concise and readable.

    * Understanding Terinary Operators
     ->A terinary operator is a one-liner shorthand for if-else statements.
     ->It uses the syntax: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse.
     
    * Condition     : A statement that returns true or false ?
    * value if True : what happens if the condition is true ?
    * value if false: what happens if the condition is false ?

  Example:

  JavaScript

  const totalmarks = 60;
  if (totalMarks < 40) {
    console.log("You need to work hard.");
  } else {
    console.log("You cleared the exam.");
  }
  
  output:
  You clered the exam.

  converting to a Ternary Operator 
  The same logic can be written using a ternary operator:

  JavaScript 
   
  const totalmarks = 60;
  console.log(totalmarks < 40 ? "You need to work hard." : "You cleared the exam.");

  output:
  You cleared the exam.

  ---------------- Nested Ternary Operatorss ------------- 

  ->You can also use nested ternary operators, but be cautious as it can make the code harder to read:

  JavaScript 

    const score = 85;
    const grade = score > 90 ? 'A':
                score > 80 ? 'B':
                score > 70 ? 'C':
                score > 60 ? 'D': 'F':

    console.log('Your grade is :$(grade)');
    
    output:
    Your grade is :B 

  Example: Using Ternary Operators to Replace if-else Statements:
  
  JavaScript 

  const totalMarks = 60;

  if (total Marks < 40) {
    console.log("You need to work hard.");
  } else if (totalMarks < 60) {
    console.log("B grade");
  } else if (totalMarks < 75) {
    console.log("A grade");
  } else if (totalmarks < 85) {
    console.log("A+ grade");
  } else {
    console.log("Genius");  
  }

  output:
   A grade 

   converting to Ternary Operators 
    we can achieve the same logic using a single line of code with ternary operators:

   JavaScript 
   
     const totalMarks = 60;

     const result = totalMarks < 40 ? "You need to work hard." : totalMarks < 60 ? "B grade" :
                                                               : totalMarks < 75 ? "A grade" :
                                                               : totalMarks < 85 ? "A+ grade":"Genius";
     console.log(result);
     
     output:
     A grade 

    * Advantages :-
     
     1. Conciseness: Ternary operators make the code shorter.
     2. Readability: For simple conditions, terninary operators can make the code to easier to read.
     3. Single-Line expressions: Ternary operators are useful for inline assignments. 

    * DrawBacks :-
    
     1.Complexity: For multiple or nested conditions, ternary operators can become hard to read and maintain.
     2.Debugging : Debugging nested ternary operators can be more challenging compared to if-else statements.
