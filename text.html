-------------- JavaScript variables--------------

What is a variable?

->A variable is a named placeholder that holds data or information.
->In simpler terms,variables are used to store values that can be used and manipulated throughtout your code.
->Think of variables as containers that hold different types of data, such as numbers,text,boolean values,or more complex data structures like arrays and objects.

uses of variables?

->Let's consider an e-commerce application where you need to add products to a wishlist or a cart.
->JavaScript needs to store the information about these products to manange them effectively;
->By storing data in variables, you can easily reference and manipulate that data later in your code.

How to declare variables in JavaScript?

->There are three main ways to declare variables in javascript:var,let, and const.
->Each has it's own use case and scope rules.

*Declaring variables with var 

->The var keyword is used to declare a variable with var:
 
Javascript 

var message:
message = "Hello, Geeks!";
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, Geeks!
output 
Hello, Geeks!

*Declaring variables with let

->The let keyword is a more modern way to declare variables and is generally preferred over var due to its block-scoping feature.

Javascript

let text = "Javascript is the best!"
console.log(text): // outputs: Javascript is the best!
output
Javascript is the best!

*Declaring variables with const 

->The const keyword is used to declare variables that are meant to be constants,meaning their values should not change once assigned.

Javascript

const number = 10;
console.log(number): // Output: 10
output
10

variable Assignments and Reassignments

->Variables declared with var and let can be reassinged new values, while variables declared with const cannot.

JavaScript 

var message = "Hello, Geeks!";
message = "Hello, GeeksForGeeks!";
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello GeeksforGeeks!

Let text = "JavaScript is the best!";
text = "JavaScript is awesome!";
console.log(text); // Outputs: JavaScript is awesome!

const number = 10;
number = 20; // Error: Assignment to constamt variable
output 
Hello,GeeksForGeeks!
JavaScript is awesome!

Error: Assignment to constant variable

Why use Let and Const over Var?

*Block Scoping:
->Let and const are block-scoped meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined.
->Var is function-Scoped, which can lead to unexpected behaviour.
*Re-assignment:
->const ensures that variables cannot be reassigned, which helps prevent accidental chnges to important values.

------------- Variable Naming Convention ----------- 

->naming variables is a crucial and often overlooked skill in programming.
->A well-named variable can reveal whether the code was written by a beginner or an experienced developer.
->In real-world projects,much time is spent modifying and extending code. 
->This task becomes significantly easier when variable names are clear and descriptive.

*Rules for naming Variables 

Before we discuss how to come up with good variable names, let's review the rules for creating them:

1.Characters Allowed: A variable name can consist of letters both(uppercase and lowercase),numbers, the dollar sign($), and the underscore(_).
2.No leading numbers: A variable name cannot start with a number but can end with one.
3.No special Characters: Avoid special characters like @,#,%,etc.

JavaScript 

Let username:
Let age:
Let _isValid:
$pace:
number1:
number_2:

->When a variable name consists of multiple words, you should not separate them with spaces, Instead, use camelcase or underscores.

JavaScript

Let userName; // camelCase
Let user_age; // Underscore

writing Good Variable Names 

->Good variable names should describe the types of data stored in them. 
->This practice enhances code readability and maintainability,especially in larger codebases.
->Here are some tips for writing good variable names:
 1.Descriptive Names: The name should convey the variable's purpose or the type of data it holds.
 2.consistent Naming Convention:Follow a consistent naming convention, such as camelcase, for  easier readability.

 practical Examples:

JavaScript

Let userName = "Prakash";
console.log(userName); // outputs: Prakash

The variable name username clearly indicates that it stores a user's name.Now, imagine If we named it x instaed:

JavaScript

Let x = "Prakash";
console.log(x); // outputs: Prakash 

variable Name Conventions 

1.Single word Variables: use descriptive names for single-word variables.

JavaScript
Let score = 100;

2.Multiple words Variables: Use camelcase or underscores.

JavaScript
Let homeaddress = "123 main St": // camelcase 
Let home_address = "123 Main St": // using underscore 

3.case Sensitivity: Remember that variable names are  case-sensitive.

JavaScript
Let userAge = 25;
Let UserAge = 30; // Different variables 

Avold unnecessary symbols 

while $ and - are allowed , avold using them unnecessarily as they can make the code look clottered  and unprofessional.only use these symbols if they enhance the clarity of your code. 

JavaScript
Let $price = 100;
Let -isvalid = true;

------------ Summary ------------

->In Summary, good variable names are essential for writing clean,readable, and maintainable code.
->Follow these guidelines to improve variable naming skills:

1.Use descriptive names that convey the variable's purpose.
2.follow a consistent naming convention naming convention,such as camelcase.
3.Avold starting variable names with numbers.
4.Avold unnecessary symbols like $ and -.

------------ Data types ------------

->JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language used for both Client-side and server-side programming.
->One of the key concepts in JavaScript is the use of data types.

What are Data types? 

->In programming, data types refers to the kind of value a variable can hold.
->In JavaScript, data types are broadly classified into two groups:
  *Primitive Data types
 *Non-Primitive Data types

1. Strings:
->A String is a data type used to represent texual data.
->A String is any set of characters enclosed in quotes, either single(' ') or double(" ") or even backticks(` `).

JavaScript

Let username = "Prakash";
console.log(username); // outputs: Prakash

output
Prakash

Note: If you omit the quotes, JavaScript will treat the text as a variable name, which will cause an error if the variable is not defined.

2.Numbers:
->The number data type is used to declare a numeric values.
->In JavaScript, numbers can be integers or floating-point values.

JavaScript

Let age = 25;
console.log(typeof age); // outputs: number

Let price = 19.99;
console.log(typeof price); // outputs: number

output
number
number

Note:If you enclose numbers in quotes, they become strings.

3.Booleans:
->A Boolean data type has only two possible values:True or False.
->It is tyically used to perform conditional,checks or represent binary states, such as whether a product is in a shopping cart or not.

JavaScript

Let is product in cart = true;
console.log(typeof isProductInCart); // outputs: boolean

output
boolean

Note: 1.A Boolean can be checked using conditional statements like if-else.
      2. If you try to use "true" or "false" (with quotes), they will be treated as strings, not booleans.

4.undefined:
->The undefined data type is used  when a variable is declared but not yet assined a value.
->JavaScript automatically assigns the value undefined to such variables.

JavaScript

Let username;
console.log(type of username); // outputs: undefined
console.log(username); // outputs: undefined

output
undefined
undefined

5.null:
->The Null Data Type is used to represent the intentional absence of any value.
->It is explicitly set to indicate that variable should have no value.

JavaScript

Let user= null;
console.log(user); // outputs: null
console.log(type of user); // outputs: object

output
null
object

6.Objects:
->An Object is a non- primitive data type used to store collections of data. 
->Objects can hold multiple values as key-value pairs.
->You can create an object using curly braces {}.

JavaScript

const person = {
   name: "Prakash",
   age: 25,
   education: "Engineer"
};
console.log(typeof person); // outputs: object

output
object 

7.Arrays:
->An array is a special type of object used to store ordered collections of values.
->Arrays are defined using square brackets [].

JavaScript

const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
console.log(typeof fruits); // outputs: object

output
object  

------------ Summary ------------
Here are the primary data types we discussed:

1.String:Text enclosed in quotes.
2.Number:Integers or floating-point numbers.
3.Boolean:True or False values.
4.undefined:Variables declared but not assigned a value.
5.null:Represents "No value". 
6.Object:Non-primitive type for storing collections of data. 
7.Array:A special type of object for storing list of values.

------- Concatenation and Template ----------- 

* String Concatenation:
   ->String Concatenation is the process of joining two or more Strings together using the + operator.
   ->This method has been around since the early days of JavaScript.

Example
Suppose we have two variables, username and age, and we want to create a message that includes these variables:

JavaScript
let username = "Vinod";
let age = 22;
let message = my name is " + username + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
console.log(message); // outputs: my name is Vinod and I am 22 years old.

* Template Literals:
    ->Template Literals provide a more readable and convenient way to include variables in Srtings.
    ->They are enclosed by backtics ['] and allow embedded expressions using ${}.

Example
We can achieve the same result as above using template literals.

JavaScript
let username = "Prakash";
let age = 25;
let message = `My name is ${username} and I am ${age} years old.
console.log(message);

// outputs: My name is Prakash and I am 25 years old.

   Advantages of template Literals

1.Readability: Template Literals improve the readability of your code by avolding the clutter of multiple + operators.
2.Multiline Strings:Template Literals  allow for multiline strings without the need for escape sequences.

multiple Example:

JavaScript

Let username ="Jeevan"
Let age =22;
Let multilineMessage ='My name is $(username).
I am $(age) years old.
I Love to code, eat and sing.';
console.log(multilineMessage);

output:
My name is Jeevan.
Iam 22 Years old.
I love to code, eat and sing.

Practice Exercise 

JavaScript

Let hubby="Reading"
Let concatenationMessage ="My favourite h0bby is " + hobby + ".";
Let templateLiteral Message ='My favourite hobby is $(hobby).';
console.log(concatenationMessage);
console.log(templateLiteralmessage);

Output
my favorite hobby is Reading.
My favorite hobby is Reading.

JavaScript

Let subject = "English"
Let concatenationMessage = "Iam good in " + subject + ".";
Let templateLiteralmessage = 'Iam good in $(subject).';
console.log(concentationmessage);
console.log(templateLiteralMessage);

output:
Iam good in English.
Iam good in English.

-------- Arithmetic Operators --------- 
->Mathematical operations i JavaScript are similar to those in other programming languages.
->However, JavaScript behaves differently when applying mathematical operators to Strings.

* Basic mathematical operations 
->We can perform basic arithematic operations such as addition,subtraction,multiplication,finding remainders, and exponentation

Example:
Let's start with two variables:

JavaScript
const x =12;
const y =3;

// Addition
console.log(x + y); // outputs: 15

// Subtraction
console.log(x - y); // outputs: 9

// Multiplication
console.log(x * y); // outputs: 36

// Division
console.log(x / y); // outputs: 4

// Remainder
console.log(x % y); // outputs: 0 

// Exponentiation
console.log(x ** 2); // outputs: 144
console.log(y ** 3); // outputs: 27

output:
15
9
36
4
0
144
27

* Type conversions with Operators 
->JavaScript automatically handles type conversion in many cases.

1.Adding Strings and Numbers 
->When  adding a string and a number, JavaScript treats the number as a string and concatenates them.

JavaScript
const x = "12";
const y = "3";
console.log(x + y); // outputs: 123

output:
123

2.Other operations with Strings and Numbers for subtraction, multiplication, and division, JavaScript converts Strings to numbers if possible.

JavaScript
console.log(x - y); // outputs: 9
console.log(x * y); // outputs: 36
console.log(x / y); // outputs: 4

3.Mixing Types 
->When one operand is a number and the other is a String:

JavaScript
const x = 12;
const y = "3";
console.log(x + y); // outputs: 123
console.log(x - y); // outputs: 9
console.log(x * y); // outputs: 36 
console.log(x / y); // outputs: 4

output:
123  
9
36
4

4.Handling Non-Numeric Strings 
->If the Srting cannot be converted to number, JavaScript returns NaN (Not a Number)

JavaScript
const x = "apple";
const y = "mango"
console.log(x + y) ; // outputs: applemango
console.log(x - y); // outputs: NaN
console.log(x * y); // outputs: NaN
console.log(x / y); // outputs: NaN

output:
applemango
NaN
NaN
NaN

----------- Type Conversion -----------
->Type conversion is an essential concept in JavaScript that allows us to convert one data type into another.
->This is particularly useful in situations where data from an HTML input or text area needs to be manipulated as a different type, such as converting a String to a number.

* Why use Type conversions?
->Consider an HTML text area that always provides data as a String.
->If the user enters a number, you might need this number to be treated as a numeric value for calculations.

* Conerting Strings to Numbers 
->Lets starts with an example of converting Strings to numbers.
->Suppose you have two variables string numbers as Strings:

JavaScript
const a = "3";
const b = "10";

Note: If you try to add these Strings directly, JavaScript will concatenate them, resulting in "310" instead of the nuimeric sum 13.

JavaScript 
console.log(a + b); // outputs: 310

To achieve the desired numeric addition, you need to convert these Strings to numbers using the number function.

JavaScript
const aNumber = Number(a);
const bNumber = Number(b);
console.log(aNumber + bNumber); // outputs: 13

Example with Type Checking 

Here's an example of converting numbers to Srtings and their types:

JavaScript
const num1 = 123;
const num2 = 456.78;
const str1 = String(num1);
const str2 = String(num2);

console.log(type of num1); // outputs: number
console.log(type of num2); // outputs: number
console.log(type of str1); // outputs: string
console.log(type of str2); // outputs: string

output:
number  
number
string
String
->Initially, num1 and num2 are numbers. after conversion, str1 and str2 are strings.

* Converting to Boolean

->Boolean conversion is another useful type conversion.
-This is done using the Boolean function, which converts values to true or false.

Conversion Rules
  1.Any non empty String is true.
  2.An empty String is false.
  3.The number 0 is false.
  4.Any other number is true.

  Example with Strings

JavaScript
const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "";
console.log(Boolean(str1)); // outputs: true
console.log(Boolean(str2)); // outputs: false

output:
true
false

Example with Numbers

JavaScript
const num1 = 42;
const num2 = 0;
console.log(Boolean(num1)); // outputs: true
console.log(Boolean(num2)); // outputs: false

output:
true
false

Example1:Converting User Input from Text Area 

JavaScript
const input = "42";
const number = Number(input);

 if (!isNaN(number)) {
   console.log(number + 8); // outputs: 50
} else {
   console.log("Invalid input"); 
   }

output:
50

Example2:checking Boolean values 

JavaScript
console.log(Boolean("Prakash")); // outputs: true
console.log(Boolean("")); // outputs: false
console.log(Boolean(100)); // outputs: true 
console.log(Boolean(0)); // outputs: false

output:
true
false
true
false

------------ Readlinesyc ------------
->ReadlineSyc is a JavaScript (Node.js) library that allows developers to take user input from the terminal in a synchronous way.
->It is commonly used in command-line based JavaScript programs where the programs need to pause and wait for user input.

1.Set Up readline-syc:

JavaScript
const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

2.Ask for User input:

JavaScript
const UserName = readlineSync.question('May I know your name? ');
console.log(`Welcome, ${UserName}!`);

3.convert and Use Numeric Input: 

Let's extend this to ask the user for thier age and calculate thier birth year.

JavaScript
const userAge = readlineSync.question('May I Know your age? ');

// Convert the input to a number
const userAgeNumber = Number(userAge);

// check if the conversion was successful 
if (!isNaN(userAgeNumber)) {
   const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
   const birthYear = currentYear - userAgeNumber;
   console.log(`You were born in the year ${birthYear}.`);
} else {
   console.log('Please enter a valid number for age.');
}
