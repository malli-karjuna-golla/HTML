-------- TYpes of CSS -------

There are three types of CSS which are given below:

     *Internal or Embedded CSS
     *External CSS 
     

#Inline CSS:
  ->Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached element is known as inline CSS.
  ->This kind of Style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute.
  
#Internal or Embedded CSS:
   ->This can be used whwn a single HTML document must be styled uniquely.
   ->The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file.
   
#External CSS:
   ->External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of the big attribute.
   ->For Example (class,id,heading...etc).
   ->CSS property is written in a separate file with .css extension and sholud be linked to the HTML document using link tag.
   ->This means that for each element,style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.
   ->link tag is used to link the external style sheet with the html. 
   ->href attribute is used to specify the location of the external style sheet file.
   
-------- Properties of CSS -------

->Inline CSS has the highest priority,then comes internal/Embedded followed by External CSS which has the least priority.
->Multiple style sheets can be defined on one page.
->If for an HTML tag,styles are defined in multiple sheets then the below order will be followed.
    *As inline has the highest priority,any styles that are defined in the internal and external style sheets are overhidden by inline sheets.
    *Internal or Embedded stands second in the priority list and overrides the styles in the external style sheet.
    *External style sheets have the least priority,if there are no styles defined either in inline or internal style sheet then external style sheet rules are applied for the HTML tags.
