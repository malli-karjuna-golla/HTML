-------------- Split and Join ------------ 

->The split and join methods in JavaScript are powerful tools for manipulating strings and arrays.
->The split method is used to divide a string into an array of substrings, while the join method combines an array of elements into a single string.
->These methods often work together to achieve various tasks, such as checking if a string is a palindrome.

1. Split Method :- 
 The split method splits a string into an array of substrings baesd on a specified separator.
 syntax:
   str.split(separator, limit)

  1.separator:
 ->It is used to specify the character, or the regular expression, to use for splitting the string.
 ->If the separator is unspecified then the entire string becomes one single array element.
 ->The same also happens when the separator is not present in the string.
 ->If the separator is an empty string ("") then every character of the string is separated.
 
  2.limit:
 ->Defines the upper limit on the number of splits to be found in the given string.
 ->If the string remains unchecked after the limit is reached then it is not reported in the array.

 Return value:
 ->This function returns an array of strings that is formed after splitting the given string at each point where the separator occurs.
 
Example1:

 JavaScript 

   function func() {
    var str = 'GeeksforGeeks'
    var array = str.split("for");
    console.log(array);
   }
    func();

output:
['Geeks','Geeks'] 

Example2:

 JavaScript

   function func() {
    var str = 'It iS a Sr&e@@t Day.'
    var array = str.split("");
    console.log(array);
   }
    func();

output:
['It, iS, a, Sr&e@@t, Day.']

Example3:

 JavaScript 

    function func() {
     var str = 'It iS a Sr&e@@t Day.'
     var array = str.split("".2);
     console.log(array);
    }
     func();

output:
['It, iS'] 

2.Array.join() method :-
 ->The arr.join() method is used to join the elements of an array into a string.
 ->The elements of the string will be separated by a specified separator and it's default value is a comma(,).
  syntax:
   array.join(separator)

Parameters:
->This method accepts single parameter as mentioned above and discussed below:
* separator:
 ->It is Optional i.e, it can be either used as parameter or not.
 ->It's default value is comma (,).

 Return value:
 ->It returns the string which contain the collection of array's elements.
 Example:

   var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
   print(a.join('|'));

  output: 1|2|3|4|5|6

Program1:

 JavaScript
   function func() {
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    console.log(a, join());
   }
    func();

output: 1,2,3,4,5,6

Program2:

 JavaScript
   function func() {
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    console.log(a, join(""));
   }
    func();

output: 123456

3.Use Cases for Split and Join :

* Reversing a String : As demonstrated above, split a string into characters, reverse the array, and join it back into a string.
* Transforming Data  : For example, converting CSV string into an array and back.
* String Manipulation: Esaily modify parts of a string by splitting it into an array, altering the array, and joining it back into a string. 

------------ Spread operator ---------- 

->The spread operator in JavaScript is a powerful feature that allows you to unpack elements from arrays or properties from objects.
->It is represented by three dots (...) and can be used in various contexts to achieve different outcomes.

* Spreading an Array:- 
->The spread operator can be used to spread the elements of an array into another array or to perform operations that require unpacking of array elements
 syntax:
 var variablename1 = [...value];

->In the above syntax, ... is spread operator which will target all values in particular variable.
->when ... occurs in function call or alike, li is called a spread operator.
->Spread operator can be used in many cases, Like when we want to expand, copy, concat, with math object 

Example:

JavaScript 
    
 const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 console.log(...arr);

 output:
 1 2 3 4 5

* Using Spread Operator to merge Arrays 
  one of the common use cases of the spread operator is to merge multiple arrays.

  JavaScript 

   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9];
   const mergedArr = [...arr1,...arr2];
   console.log(mergedArr);

output:

[
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
  6, 7, 8, 9
] 

* Adding Elements while merging 
  You can also add elements in between or around the arrays while merging 
 
  JavaScript 

    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const arr2 = [8, 9];
    const combinedArr = [...arr1, 6, 7, ...arr2, 10, 11];
    console.log(combinedArr);

output:

[
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
  6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
  11
]

* Preventing Mutation 
->one of the key advantages of using the spread operator is that it prevents mutation of the original arrays.
->This is important especially in functional programming and when dealing with state in applications like React.
 
 JavaScript 

  const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const arr3 = [...arr1, 6, 7];
  console.log(arr1);
  console.log(arr3);

output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
[
  1, 2, 3, 4,
  5, 6, 7
] 

* Spreading Operator in Objects 
The spread operator can also be used with objects to copy or merge them.

Copying an Object 

 JavaScript 

  const obj1 = [a:1, b:2];
  const obj2 = [...obj1];
  console.log(obj2);

output:

[a:1, b:2] 

* Merging Objects 

  JavaScript 
   
   const obj1 = (a:1, b:2);
   const obj2 = (c:3, d:4);
   const mergedObj = (...obj1, ...obj2);
   console.log(mergedObj);

output:

 ['a', 'b', 'c']
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
 ['a', 'b', 'c'] 

 * Updating Properties 

  JavaScript 

    const obj1 = (a:1, b:'2');
    const updatedObj = (...obj1, b:3);
    console.log(updatedObj);

output:

 {{(a:1, b:3) 

->Even though we get the content on one array inside the other one, but actually it is array inside another array.

JavaScript 

  Let arr = ['a','b'];
  Let arr2 = [...arr, 'c','d'];
  console.log(arr2);

  output:

  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] 

------------ Math ------------ 

->The math object in JavaScript has different properties that we can make use of to do.

  JavaScript 

  console.log(Math.min(1,2,3,-1));

output: -1

->Now consider that we have an array instead of a list, this above Math object method would nt work and will return NaN.

 JavaScript

  Let arr = [1,2,3,-1];
  console.log(Math.min(array));

output: NaN

->Whwn ...arr is used in the function call, it "expands" an iterable object arr into the List of arguments.
->In order to avoid this NaN output, we make use of spread operator.

 JavaScript 

  Let arr = [1,2,3,-1];
  console.log(Math.min(...arr));

output: -1

* Examples of spread operator with objects:

->ES6 has added spread property to object literals in JavaScript.
->The spread operator(...) with objects is used to create copies of existing objects with new or updated values.

 JavaScript 
  
  const user1 = {
      name:'Jen'
      age :22
  };
   const clonedUser = {...user1};
   console.log(clonedUser);

output:

 {name:'Jen', age:22}

 JavaScript 

  const user1 = {
    name:'Jen',
    age :22;
  };

  const user2 = {
    name:"Andrew". 
    Location:"Philadelphia"
  };

  const mergedUsers = {...user1,...user2};
  console.log(mergedUsers)

output:

{name:'Andrew', age:22, location:Philadelphia}

------------ Destructuring Array ----------- 

->The Destructuring assignment is the important technique introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) version of JavaScript that provides a shorthand syntax.
->It makes the code shorter and more readable.

Example:

 JavaScript 

   var names = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"];
   var firstName  = names[0];
   var secondName = names[1];

    console.log(firstName);
    console.log(secondName); 

output:
  alpha
  beta

syntax:

    . Array destructuring:

  var x, y;
  [x, y] = [10, 20];
   console.log(x);
   console.log(y);
   
   . or 

  [x, y, ---restof] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
   console.log(x);
   console.log(y);
   console.log(resstof);
   
    . Object destructuring:

   ({x, y} = {x:10, y:20});
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
    
   ({x, y, ...restof} = (x:10, y:20, m:30, n:40))
   console.log(x);
   console.log(y);
   console.log(restof);

Example1:

    JavaScript 

      var names = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"];
      var [firstName, secondname] = names;

      console.log(firstName);
      console.log(secondName);

      var [firstName, secondName] = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"];
 
      console.log(firstName);
      console.log(secondName);

  output:
  
   alpha
   beta
   alpha
   beta

Example2:

    JavaScript 

     var [firstName,,thirdname] = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"];
     console.log(firstName);
     console.log(thirdname);

  output:

  alpha
  beta 
  
Example3:

    JavaScript 

     var[firstName,,...lastname] = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"];
     console.log(firstname);
     console.log(secondname);

  output:
  
  alpha
  ['gamma', 'delta'] 

Example4:

    JavaScript

     var names = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"];
     var [firstName, secondName] = names;
     console.log(firstName);
     console.log(secondName);
     // After swapping
    [firstname, secondname] = [seconsName, firstName]
    console.log(firstName);
    console.log(secondName);

  output:
  
  alpha
  beta
  beta
  alpha

 Note:one advantage of using a destructuring assignment is that there is no need to manipulate an entire object in a function but just the fields that are required can be copied inside the function  

example5:

   JavaScript 

     function NamesList() {
        return ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"]
     }
    var[firstName, secondName] = NamesList();
    
    console.log(firstName);
    console.log(secondName);

  output:
  
   alpha
   beta

-------------- Destructuring Objects --------

->Destructuring objects is particularly useful when you need to extract specific properties from an object.

* Basic Object Destruturing

Example6:

    JavaScript

      const user = {
        name:'John Doe',
        age:30,
        job:'Developer'
      };
      const ( name, age, job ) = user
      console.log(name);
      console.log(age);
      console.log(job);

    output:
    
     John Doe
     30
     Developer

* Renaming Variables 

Example7:

    JavaScript

      const user = {
        name:'John Doe'
        age:30,
        job:'Developer'
      };
      const ( name: userName, age: userAge, job: userJob) = user;
      console.log(userName);
      console.log(userAge);
      console.log(userJob);

    output:
    
       John Doe
       30
       Developer

* Nested Destructuring 

Example8:

    JavaScript
     
      const user = {
        name:'John Doe',
        address: {
          city:'New York',
          country:'USA'
        }
      };
      const ( name, address: (city, country)) = user;
      console.log(name);
      console.log(city);
      console.log(country);

    output:

       John Doe
       New york 
       USA

* Destructuring Function Parameters 

->Destructuring can be used in function parameters to directly extract values from objects passed to the function.

Example10:

    JavaScript

      function displayUser({name, age})
      {
        console.log('Name: $(name), Age: $(age)');
      }

      const user = {
        name:'John Doe',
        age:30
      };

      displayUser(user);

    output:
    
    Name:John Doe
    Age :30 

--------- Iterating over Array and Copy By Reference ---------- 

->In JavaScript, the array is a simple variable that is used to store different elements.
->It is often used when we want to store a list of elements and access them by a single variable.
->Unlike most languages where the array is a reference to the multiple variables.
->In JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.

* Declaring arrays -

1st method-> 

Let s1 = "Prakash";
Let s2 = "Akash";
Let s3 = "Riya";
Let s4 = "Adarsh";

2nd method->
// Initializing while declaring 

var Arr1 = ["1", "2", "3", "Prakash",];

* Loops -

->Looping in Programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of of a set of instuctions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.
->For loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure.
->unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization,condition, and increment/decrement in one line.
syntax:
     for (initialization condition; testing condition; increment/decrement)

Example:

Let studentsName = ["rahul", "riya", "sumit". "aryan"];
Let arrLength = studentsName.length 
for(Let i = 0 ; i<arrLength : i++) {
  console.log(studentsName(i))
}

Output:

rahul
riya
sumit
aryan

*For Let of:

->The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.
->It let's you Loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

Example:

for(Let name of studentsName){{
  console.log(name) }

output:

rahul
riya
sumit
aryan

* The For in loop:
 The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an object:

 for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
 }

Example:

 for(let name in studentsName) {
  console.log(name) 
 }

output:
0
1
2
3

------------ Copy by Reference ---------- 

 * Shallow Copy:

  ->when a reference variable is copied into a new reference variable using the assignment operator, a shallow copy of the referenced object is created.

Example:

Let arr[1] = [1,2,3] 
Let arr1 = arr2;
console.log("arr1", arr)
console.log("arr2", arr)
arr2.push(4)
console.log("updated arr1", arr);
console.log("updated arr2", arr);

output:

Arr1 = [1,2,3] 
Arr2 = [1,2,3] 
Updated arr1 = [1,2,3,4] 
Updated arr2 = [1,2,3,4] 

->Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expaned in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements.
->In an object Literal, the spread syntax enumerates the poperties of an object an adds the key value pairs to the object being created.

Example:

Let arr[1] = [1,2,3]
Let arr1 = Let arr2 
console.log("arr1", arr1)
console.log("arr2", arr2)
arr2.push(4)
console.log("updated arr1", arr1);
console.log("updated arr2", arr2);
// spread operator 

Let arr3 = [....arr1]
console.log("arr3", arr3)
arr.push(5) 
console.log("arr1", arr1)
console.log("arr2", arr2)

output:

Arr1 = [1,2,3,4] 
Arr2 = [1,2,3,4] 
Updated arr1 = [1,2,3,4] 
Updated arr2 = [1,2,3,4]
arr3 = [1,2,3,4] 
Updated arr1 = [1,2,3,4] 
Updated arr3 = [1,2,3,4,5]   

  
  {
