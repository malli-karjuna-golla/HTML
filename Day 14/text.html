---------- Media Queries in CSS -----------

->Media queries in CSS is used to create a Responsive web page to make a user friendly website.
->It means that the view of web pages differ from system to system based on screen or media types.
->Media is allowing us to reshape and design the user view page of the website for specific devices like Tablets,Desktops,Moblie phones etc.
->Media queries cn be used to check many things like the following:
   1. Width and height of the device
   2. Orientation of the device
   3. Resolution of the device
   4. Aspect ratio of the device
   5. Color of the device
   6. Light level of the device
   
 ->A media query consist of a media type that can contain one or more expression which can be either true or false.
 ->The result of the query is true if the specified media matches the type of device where the document is displayed on.
 ->If the media query is true when the style is applied.
 ->In simple words,it uses the @media rule to add the block of CSS properties,based on certain conditions.
 syntax:
    @media not|only mediatype and (expressions)
     {
        CSS-Code;
    } 
-> we can add the breakpoint to see the screen width along with the width and height of the viewport for the different devices.
->A breakpoint is a point or key that determines when to change the layout by reshaping and adding the new rules inside the media queries.
->There are some common breakpoints,not a standard resolution,that can be used for the different widths & heights of devices.
 *For Moblie devices: 320px to 480px
 *For Tablets: 481px to 768px
 *For laptop or small-size screen:768px-1024px.
 *For Desktop or large-size screen:1024px-1200px.
 *For Extra large size device:1200px-more. 
->These breakpoints can help to build responsive designs(i.e mobile-first design) by specifying the different sets of values for width & height.
->We can also use the media queries for changing the layout of a webpage that will be depending on the orientation of the browser.

------------- Flex box ------------ 
Flexbox:- 
 ->It is also called as flexible box model.
 ->It is basically a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within container.
 ->Flexbox is different from the block model which is vertically bias and the inline which is horizontally bias.
 ->Flexbox was created for small-scales layouts and there's another standard called grids which is geared more towards the large scale layouts.
 ->It works similar to the way to Twitter bootstrap grid work system works.
 ->Flex box is responsive and moblie-friendly. 
 ->To start with flexbox firstly create a flex container.
 ->To create a flex container set the display property to flex. 
 Example:
    .main-container {
         display:flex;
    }
 
------------ Flex properties --------- 
  *flex-direction 
  *flex-wrap 
  *flex-flow 
  *justify-content 
  *align-items 
  *align-content 
  
 1.flex-direction:
 ->The flex-direction is used to define the direction of flexible item.
 ->The default axis is horizontal in flexbox,so the items flow into a row.
Syntax:
    // Stacking flex items column wise flex-direction:column;
    // Stacking flex items from bottom to top flex-direction:column-reverse;
    // STacking flex items row wise flex-direction:row;
    // Stacking flex items from right to left flex-direction:row-reverse;

 2.flex-wrap:
 ->The flex-wrap property is used to define the wrap of flex-items. 
 ->If flex-wrap property set to wrap then browser's window set the box.
 ->If browser window is smaller than elements then elements go down to the next line.
 Syntax:
     // wrap flex items when necessary flex-wrap:wrap;
     // flex items will not wrap flex-wrap:nowrap;
 Note:The flex-flow is a shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap
 syntax:
       flex-flow:row wrap;
            
     
 3.justify-content:
 ->The justify-content property is used to align the flex-items according to the main axis within a flexbox container.
 syntax:
    // Assigns the flex-items at the center -justify-content:center;
    // The space is distributed around the flexbox  items and it also adds the space before the first item and after the last one-justify-content:space-around;
   // space between the lines - justify-content:space-between;
   // Alligns the flex items at the beginning of the container - justify-content:flex-start;
   // Alligns the flex-items at the end of the container - justify-content:flex

 4.Align items:
 ->This property is used to align flex items vertically according to cross axis.
 Syntax:
      // Align the flex  items in the middle of the container - align-items:center;
      // Flexbox items are aligned at the baseline of the cross axis - align-items:baseline;
      // Streches the flex-items - align-items:Strech;
      // Align the items at the top of the container - align-items:flex-start;
      // Aligns elements at the bottom of the container - align-items:flex-end;
      
 5.align-content:
  ->This property is used to defines how each flexline is aligned within a flexbox.
  ->And it only applicable if flex-wrap:wrap is applied i.e there are multiple line of flexbox items present.
  Syntax:
  // Displays the flex lines with equal space between them - align-content:space-between;
  // Displays the flex lines at the start of the container - align-content:flex-start;
  // Displays the flex items at the end of the container - align-content:flex-end;
  // Distributed equally around the flex line - align-content:strech;
  
              ---------------------- Grid ------------------------ 
  ->The CSS grid layout module is used to create a grid- based layout system,with the help of rows and columns it makes it easier to design any wbpage without using floats and positioning.
