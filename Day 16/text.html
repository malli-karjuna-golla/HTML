----------- Transform property ---------

->The Transform property in CSS is used to change the coordinate space of the visual formatting model.
->This is used to add effects like skew,rotate,translate,etc on elements.

Syntax:

transform:none|transform-functions|initial|inhert;

Note:The transformations can be of 2-D or 3-D type.

Values:

*none:No transormation takes place.
*matrix:(x,x,x,x,x,x):It specifies a matrix transformation of 2-D type.It takes 6 values.
*matrix3d(x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x):It specifies a matrix transformtion of 3-D type.It takes 9 values.
*translate(x,y):It Specifies a translation across the X and Y axes.
*translate3d(x,y,z):It specifies a translation across the X,Y and Z axes.
*translateX(x):It specifies the translation across the X-axis only.
*translateY(y):It specifies the translation across the Y-axis only.
*translateZ(z):It specifies the translation across the Z-axis only.
*rotate(angle):It specifies the angle of the rotation.
*roateX(angle):It specifies the rotation along with the X-axis corresponding to the angle of rotation.
*rotateY(angle):It specifies the rotation along with the Y-axis corresponding to the angle of rotation.
*rotateZ(angle):It specifies the rotation along with the Z-axis corresponding to the angle of rotation.
*scale(x,y):It specifies the scale transformation along the X and Y axes.
*scale3d(x,y,z):It specifies the scale transformation along the X,Y and Z axes.
*scaleX(x):It specifies the scale transformation along the X-axis only.
*scaleY(y):It specifies the scale transformation along the Y-axis only.
*scaleZ(z):It specifies the scale transformation along the Z-axis only.
*skew(x-angle,y-angle):It specifies the skew transformation along the X and Y axes.
*skewX(x-angle):It specifies the skew transformation along the X-axis only. 
*skewY(y-angle):It specifies the skew transformation along the Y-axis only.
*skewZ(z-angle):It specifies the skew transformation along the Z-axis only.
*perspective(x):It specifies the perspective of an element.
perspective property:
  *initial:it initializes the element to its default value.
  *inherit:it inherits the perspective value from its parent element.

  ------------ Transitions -------------

  ->Transitions in CSS allows us to control the way in which transition takes place between the two states of the element.
  ->Transition allows us to determine how the change in color takes place.
  ->we can use the transistions to animate the changes, and make the changes visually appealing to the user.
  ->There are four CSS properties which you should use,all or in part.

  1.transition-property:THis property allows you to select the CSS properties which you want to animate during transition.
  syntax:
    transition-property:none | all | property | property1,property2,.....propertyN;
  Values:
   *none is used to specify that no property should be selected.
   *all is used to specify all the properties to be selected,though not all properties are animate-able, only the the properties which are animate-able will be influenced.
   *we can specify a single property or a set of comma separated properties propert1,property2,......propertyN. 
   
  2.transition-duration:This property allows you to determine how long it will take to complete the transition from one CSS property to the other.
  syntax:
    transition-duration:time;
  Note:Here,time can be in seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms),you should use 's' or 'ms' after the number (without quotes).

  3.transition-timing-function:This property allows you to determine the speed of change and the manner of change,during the transition.like, the change should be fast at the beginning and slow at the end,etc.
  syntax:
    transition-timing-function:ease | linear | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out | step-start | step-end | steps(int, start|end) | cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n);  
 Note:There are other values which this transistion timing function can,take only the most frequent and simple are mentioned here.
 
  4.transition-delay:This property allows you to determine the amount of time to wait before the transition actually starts to take place.
  syntax:
    transition-delay:time;

  *The Shorthand property :
   ->You can combine all the four transition properties mentioned above, into one single shorthand property.
   syntax:
     transition:(property name) | (duration) | (timing-function) | (delay);
